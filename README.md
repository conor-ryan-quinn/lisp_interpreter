# Simple Lisp in Haskell

This is a simple Lisp interpreter written in Haskell.

## Run

Run the build script build.sh. This will compile the interpreter and start a
REPL. When you would like to exit the REPL, type "quit". If you would prefer to
run the interpreter on a lisp file, build the interpreter, cd into source (where
the executable will live) and run the executable with the lisp file as a parameter.

## Todo

* Add support for the Lisp Standard Library.
